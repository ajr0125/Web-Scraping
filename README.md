# Web-Scraping

Project Overview

This project is a web scraping and data analysis initiative that involves extracting and analyzing data from various sources, including Wikipedia and tennis-related websites. The project is structured around three main phases:

Web Scraping of U.S. Companies by Revenue: The first phase involved scraping data from a Wikipedia page that lists the largest companies in the United States by revenue. The data was extracted, cleaned, and stored for further analysis.

ATP Player Match Stats: In the second phase, data was scraped from a tennis website detailing statistics for 40 ATP players for the year 2024. This included matches played, wins, losses, win percentages, and specific set score counts. This data was extracted and cleaned for analysis.

Wimbledon Champions and Runner-Ups: The final phase focused on scraping two Wikipedia pages listing Wimbledon champions and runner-ups for the gentlemen's and ladies' singles tournaments during the open era. The data was analyzed to determine how often each country won the title or earned the runner-up spot. This analysis was presented through pie charts and stacked bar plots to show the distribution of wins and runner-up finishes by country for both genders.

Key Steps in the Project:
Web Scraping: Utilized BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape structured data from various websites.

Data Analysis: Cleaned and analyzed data using pandas. Generated visualizations such as pie charts and stacked bar plots to analyze country-based trends in Wimbledon titles and runner-up positions.

Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations that highlight country-specific statistics for Wimbledon.
